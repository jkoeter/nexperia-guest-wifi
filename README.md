Nexperia router guest-wifi controller

This code is to control (turn on/off) the guest wifi of a Nexperia V10 router (that is used by KPN in the Netherlands).

I have all devices of my kids attached to the guest-wifi network. This way I can disable all devices by just turning off the guest-wifi when it is time to sleep or do homework. The script can be used with a Raspberry Pi in a cron-job to automatically schedule on/off times.
